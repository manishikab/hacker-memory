What have I already learned, and how does my brain behave over time?
Gives insights without user searching for them (makes it different than plain notes app)
forgetting curve to make it more like memory system? This system models how a hacker learns, forgets, and repeats mistakes — and intervenes.


Goal: Given a past hacker experience, the system should be able to
- recognize similar future problems
- surface relevant past experience
- generate meta-insight about learning patterns

e.g.:
“What mistakes cost me the most time?”
“What knowledge do I underuse?”
“How has my thinking evolved?”

Q: "Have I Solved This Before: TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
A: “Yes. You hit a similar error twice before — both times due to missing API guards.”
